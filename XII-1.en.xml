        <text>In a communication received by the Secretary-General on 8 November 1976, the Government of Bahrain confirmed that the general reservation "is intended to constitute a general declaration of policy of the Government of the State of Bahrain and should not be interpreted as expanding or diminishing the scope of the Convention or its application to States parties to the Convention."</text>
        <text>With regard to the said reservation, the Governrment of Israel, in communication received by the Secretary-General on 23 December 1976, stated the following:</text>
        <text>"The instrument deposited by the Government of Bahrain contains a statement of political pronouncements, which are moreover, in flagrant contradiction to the principles, objects and purposes of the Organization. That pronouncement by the Government of Bahrain cannot in any way affect whatever obligations are binding upon Bahrain, under general international law or under particular treaties."</text>
        <text>The Government of Israel will, insofar as concerns the substance of the matter, adopt towards the Government of Bahrain an attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>
        <text>Identical communications, &lt;i&gt;mutatis mutandis &lt;/i&gt;, were received from the Government of Israel on 25 July 1980, in respect of the declarations made by Democratic Yemen (see note 9 ) and the United Arab Emirates upon acceptance of the Convention.</text>

        <text>In communications addressed to the Secretary-General on 14 September 1961, 30 November 1961 and 14 March 1962, respectively, the Governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Norway and Greece, referring to the declaration made by Cambodia, stated that they assumed that it was a declaration of policy and did not constitute a reservation; and that it had no legal effect with regard to the interpretation of the Convention. They further stated that they would welcome assurances from the Government of Cambodia that the declaration was to be understood in this sense.</text>
        <text>In a communication addressed to the Secretary-General on 31 January 1962, the Government of Cambodia stated that ". . . the Royal Government agrees that the first part of the declaration which it made at the time of the acceptance of the Convention is of a political nature. It therefore has no legal effect regarding the interpretation of the Convention. The statements contained in the third paragraph of the declaration, on the other hand, constitute a reservation to the Convention by the Royal Government of Cambodia."</text>
        <text>In a communication addressed to the Secretary-General on 3 July 1962, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland stated that ".. Her Majesty's Government do not share the view of the Cambodian Government that the third paragraph of the declaration constitutes a reservation, but they do not wish on that account, to raise formal objection to the terms of Cambodia's acceptance of the Convention."</text>
        <text>In a communication addressed to the Secretary-General on 23 July 1962, the Government of France stated that ". . . it considers that, for reasons of principle as well as of fact, it cannot accept the terms of the declaration in question, the third paragraph of which is, moreover, described by the Permanent Representative of Cambodia as constituting a reservation."</text>

        <text>In a communication received by the Secretary-General on 28 November 1973, the Permanent Representative of Israel to the UnitedNations stated the following:</text>
        <text>"The instrument of acceptance by the Government of Iraq of the above-mentioned Convention contains a statement of a political character in respect to Israel. In the view of the Government of Israel, this is not the proper place for making such political pronouncements, which are moreover, in flagrant contradiction to the principles, objects and purposes of the Organization. That statement, therefore, possesses no legal validity whatsoever.</text>
        <text>"The Government of Israel utterly rejects that statement and will proceed on the assumption that it has no validity as to the rights and duties of any Member State to the said Organization.</text>
        <text>"The declaration of the Government of Iraq cannot in any way affect Iraq's obligations under the Constitution of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization or whatever other obligations are binding upon that State by virtue of general international law.</text>
        <text>"The Government of Israel will, in so far as concerns the substance of the matter, adopt toward the Government of Iraq an attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>

        <text>In a note verbale accompanying the instrument of acceptance, the Permanent Representative of the United States of America drew the attention of the Secretary-General to the fact that ... "Article 2 of the Convention provides that the functions of the Organization `shall be consultative and advisory'. Article 3 of the Convention indicates that the functions of the Organization are to make recommendations and to facilitate consultation and exchange of information. The history of the Convention and the records of the conference at which it was formulated indicate no intention to nullify or alter the domestic legislation of any contracting party relating to restrictive business practices or to alter or modify in any way the application of domestic statutes governing the prevention or regulation of business monopolies. It is considered therefore, that the statement as quoted above is merely a clarification of the intended meaning of the Convention and a safeguard against any possible misinterpretation, particularly as to the application of article?."</text>
