          <Text>Pursuant to article 25, the Constitution entered into force when at least eighty States having deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval had notified the Secretary-General that they had agreed, after consultation among themselves, that the Constitution should enter into force.</Text>

For States having deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval before that date, but not participating in the said notification, the Constitution entered into force on such later date on which they notified the Secretary-General that the Constitution should enter into force for them. For States having deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession subsequent to the entry into force of the Constitution, it entered into force on the date of the said deposit.</Text>
