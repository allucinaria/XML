        <text type="para">"A reservation by which a State Party limits its responsibilities under the Convention by invoking general principles of internal law may create doubts about the commitment of the reserving State to the object and purpose of the Convention and, moreover contribute to undermining the basis of international treaty law. Under well-established international treaty law, a state is not permitted to invoke internal law as justification for its failure to perform its treaty obligations. For this reason, the Government of Norway objects to the said reservation made by the Government of Bangladesh.</text>

        <text type="para">In this context the Government of Sweden would like to recall, that under well-established international treaty law, the name assigned to a statement whereby the legal effect of certain provisions of a treaty is excluded or modified, does not determine its status as a reservation to the treaty.

        <text>In communications addressed to the Secretary-General with reference to the above-mentioned signature and/or ratification, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations of Czechoslovakia, Denmark, India, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Yugoslavia stated that, since their Governments did not recognize the Nationalist Chinese authorities as the Government of China, they could not regard the said signature or ratification as valid. The Permanent Missions of Czechoslovakia and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics further stated that the sole authorities entitled to act for China and the Chinese people in the United Nations and in international relations, and to sign, ratify, accede or denounce treaties, conventions and agreements on behalf of China, were the Government of the People's Republic of China and its duly appointed representatives.</text>
        <text>In a note addressed to the Secretary-General, the Permanent Mission of China to the United Nations stated that the Government of the Republic of China was the only legal Government which represented China and the Chinese people in international relations and that, therefore, the allegations made in the above-mentioned communica tions as to the lack of validity of the signature or ratification in question had no legal foundation whatever.</text>

        <text>In this regard, the Secretary-General received the following communications on the dates indicated hereinafter:</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Germany (17 December 1999): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany notes that the declaration with regard to article III of the Convention, application of that article in consonance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Bangladesh, constitutes a reservation of a general nature in respect of a provision of the Convention which may be contrary to the Constitution of Bangladesh.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is of the view that this general reservation raises doubts as to the full commitment of Bangladesh to the object and purpose of the Convention. It is in the common interest of States that treaties to which they have chosen to become Parties are respected, as to their object and purpose, by all Parties and that States are prepared to undertake any legislative changes necessary to comply with their obligations under these treaties.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany therefore objects to the reservation made by the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the Convention on the Political Rights of Women. This objection does not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of Bangladesh".</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Netherlands (20 December 1999): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has examined the declarations made by the Government of Bangladesh at the time of its accession to the Convention on the political rights of women and considers the declaration concerning Article III as a reservation.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands considers that such a reservation, which seeks to limit the responsibilities of the reserving State under the Convention by invoking national law, may raise doubts as to the commitment of this State to the object and purpose of the Convention and, moreover, contributedermining the basis of international treaty law.</text>
        <text>It is in the common interest of States that treaties to which they have chosen to become parties should be respected, as to object and purpose, by all parties.</text>
