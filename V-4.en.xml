        <text type="title">Declaration:</text>
        <text type="para">On the occasion of its accession to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, adopted in New York on 30 August 1961, the Republic of Argentina objects and rejects the attempt to extend the territorial application of this instrument to the Malvinas Islands made by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland upon ratification.</text>
        <text type="para">The Argentine Government recalls that the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas are an integral part of the Argentine national territory and, being illegally occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, are the subject of a sovereignty dispute between the two countries which is recognized by several international organizations.</text>
        <text type="para">In this connection, the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, in which the sovereignty dispute referred to as the Question of the Malvinas Islands is recognized and the Governments of the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are urged to resume negotiations in order to find as soon as possible a peaceful and lasting solution to the dispute. Concurrently, the Special Committee on Decolonization of the United Nations has repeatedly affirmed this view, most recently in its resolution adopted on 26 June 2014. Also, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted, on 5 June 2014, a new pronouncement, in similar terms, on the question.</text>

Consequently, the interpretative declaration in question was accepted for deposit upon the above-stipulated one year period, that is on 29 December 2010.</text>

        <text>In regard to the declaration made by Tunisia upon accession, the Secretary-General received from the Government of the following State, the following communication on the date indicated hereinafter:</text>
        <text>Netherlands (6 June 2001): </text>
        <text>"The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has examined the above mentioned declaration. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands understands the declaration of Tunisia, in particular with regard to the grounds mentioned in Nos. 4 and 6 of the declaration, in respect of article 8 to extend the grounds on which a person can be deprived of Tunisian nationality.</text>
        <text>The declaration therefore restricts one of the essential obligations of the Convention in a way contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands therefore objects to the aforesaid declaration made by the Government of the Republic of Tunisia.</text>
        <text>This objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Tunisia."</text>
