        <text type="para">On the occasion of its ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Argentine Government recalls that on 3 October 1983 the Argentine Republic rejected the extension of the application of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands.</text>
        <text type="para">The Argentine Government recalls that the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas are an integral part of the Argentine national territory and, being illegally occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, are the subject of a sovereignty dispute between the two countries which is recognized by the United Nations and other international organizations.</text>
        <text type="para">In this connection, the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, in which the sovereignty dispute referred to as the Question of the Malvinas Islands is recognized and the Governments of the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are urged to resume negotiations in order to find as soon as possible a peaceful and lasting solution to the dispute. Concurrently, the Special Committee on Decolonization of the United Nations has repeatedly affirmed this view. Also, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted, on 24 June 2010, a new pronouncement, in similar terms, on the question.</text>
        <text type="para">In ratifying the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Argentine Republic does so on the understanding that the system of communications provided for under that instrument does not apply to the right of peoples to self-determination in any context related to sovereignty disputes.</text>

        <text>Communication by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 25 October 2012:</text>
        <text>The United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations [&] recalls the Declaration made by the Argentine Republic on its ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 24 October 2011, and the subject of a depositary notification dated 27 October 2011 (reference C.N.702.2011.TREATIES-8).</text>
        <text>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland rejects the claims contained in the Declaration made by the Argentine Republic. In particular, the United Kingdom rejects the claim by the Argentine Republic to the territory of the Falkland Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. The peaceful possession of these Islands and surrounding maritime areas by the United Kingdom cannot therefore be characterized as illegal occupation.</text>
        <text>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. The United Kingdom Government attaches great importance to the principle of self determination as set out in Article 1.2 of the Charter of the United Nations and Article 1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. That principle underlies our position on the Falkland Islands.</text>
        <text>The United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations requests that the Secretary-General circulate copies of this Note to the States to whom the Declaration of the Argentine Republic was circulated.</text>
