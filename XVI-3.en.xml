        <text>In this regard, the Secretary-General received the following communications on the dates indicated hereinafter:</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Germany (17 December 1999): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany notes that this constitutes a reservation of a general nature in respect of provisions of the Convention which may be contrary to the domestic law of Bangladesh. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is of the view that this general reservation raises doubts as to the full commitment of Bangladesh to the object and purpose of the Convention. In view of the fact that the Convention contains only ten short articles the reservation to one of its core principles seems particularly problematic. It is in the common interest of States that treaties to which they have chosen to become Parties are respected, as to their object and purpose, by all Parties and that States are prepared to undertake any legislative changes necessary to comply with their obligations under these treaties.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany therefore objects to this reservation made by the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. This objection does not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of Bangladesh".</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Netherlands (20 December 1999): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands considers that such a reservation, which seeks to limit the responsibilities of the reserving State under the Convention by invoking national law, may raise doubts as to the commitment of this State to the object and purpose of the Convention and, moreover, contribute to undermining the basis of international treaty law.</text>
        <text>It is in the common interest of States that treaties to which they have chosen to become parties should be respected, as to object and purpose, by all parties.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands therefore objects to the aforesaid reservation made by the GovernmentBangladesh.</text>
        <text>This objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Bangladesh.</text>

        <text>In a notification received on 15 October 1974, the Government of the United Kingdom informed the Secretary-General of the withdrawal of the reservation corresponding to sub-paragraph a, according to which it reserved the right to postpone the application of article 2 of the Convention to Montserrat pending notification to the Secretary-General that the said article would be applied there.</text>
