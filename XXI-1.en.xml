        <text>The Secretary-General received, on 9 June 1971, a communication from the Government of Senegal denouncing this Convention as well as the Convention on the Living Resources of the High Seas, and specifying that the denunciation would take effect on the thirtieth day from its receipt. The said communication, as well as the related exchange of correspondence between the Secretariat and the Govern- ment of Senegal, was circulated by the Secretary-General to all States entitled to become parties to the Conventions concerned under their respective clauses.</text>
        <text>The notification of denunciation was registered by the Government of Senegal as at 9 June 1971, under Nos. 7477 and 8164. See United Nations, &lt;i&gt;Treaty Series &lt;/i&gt;, vol. 781, p. 332.</text>
        <text>In this connection, a communication from the Government of the United Kingdom was received by the Secretary-General on 2 January 1973, stating &lt;i&gt;inter alia &lt;/i&gt;:</text>
        <text>". . . As regards the notification by the Government of Senegal purporting to denounce the two Conventions of 1958, the Government of the United Kingdom wish to place on record that in their view those Conventions are not susceptible to unilateral denunciation by a State which is a party to them and they therefore cannot accept the validity or effectiveness of the purported denunciation by the Government of Senegal. Accordingly, the Government of the United Kingdom regard the Government of Senegal as still bound by the obligations which they assumed when they became a party to those Conventions and the Government of the United Kingdom fully reserve all their rights under them as well as their rights and the rights of their nationals in respect of any action which the Government of Senegal have taken or may take as a consequence of the said purported denunciation.</text>
        <text>"As regards the various arguments that are set out in the correspondence referred to above with reference to certain other questions relating to the law of treaties, including in particular the question ofhe funtions of the Secretary-General as a depositary of the Conventions of 1958 and the question of the duties of the Secretariat in relation to the registration of treaties and in relation to acts, notifications and communications, relating to treaties, the Government of the United Kingdom do not consider it necessary at this stage to express any view on those matters but they fully reserve their position in relation thereto and expressly reserve their right formally to make their views known at a later date.</text>
        <text>"The Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations requests that copies of this Note should be transmitted by the Secretariat to all States concerned, that is to say, all States Members of the United Nations or Members of any of the Specialised Agencies, and, since the notification by the Government of Senegal was registered by Senegal, further requests that the statement of the position of the Government of the United Kingdom in relation to that notification, as set out in the second paragraph of the present Note, should similarly be registered."</text>
        <text>The said communication was registered in the name of the Government of the United Kingdom on 2 January 1973 under Nos.?477 and 8164. See United Nations, &lt;i&gt;Treaty Series &lt;/i&gt;, vol. 854, pp.?14 and 220.</text>

        <text>On 27 October 1967, the Government of the United States of America transmitted to the Secretary-General the following communication with reference to its previous communications regarding ratifications and accessions to the Law of the Sea Conventions with reservations which were unacceptable to the United States of America:</text>
        <text>"The Government of the United States of America has received an inquiry regarding the applicability of several of the Geneva Law of the Sea Conventions of 1958 between the United States and States which ratified or acceded to those Conventions with reservations which the United States found to be unacceptable. The Government of the United States wishes to state that it has considered and will continue to consider all the Geneva Law of the Sea Conventions of 1958 as being in force between it and all other States that have ratified or acceded thereto, including States that have ratified or acceded with reservations unacceptable to the United States. With respect to States which ratified or acceded with reservations unacceptable to the United States, the Conventions are considered by the United States to be in force between it and each of those States except that provisions to which such reservations are addressed shall apply only to the extent that they are not affected by those reservations. The United States considers that such application of the Convention does not in any manner constitute any concurrence by the United States in the substance of any of the reservations involved."</text>
