        <text type="title">Declarations:</text>
        <text type="para">The Republic of Cuba declares that nothing in article 4, paragraph 2, can be construed as encouraging or condoning the use or threat of use of force in international relations which should, in all circumstances, be strictly governed by the principles of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</text>
        <text type="para">Cuba also holds the view that the relations between States should be based on the provisions of General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV).</text>
        <text type="para">Furthermore, State terrorism has historically been a fundamental concern for Cuba, which believes that its total eradication through mutual respect, friendly relations and cooperation among States, and full respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, self-determination and non-interference in internal affairs should constitute a priority for the international community.</text>
        <text type="para">Therefore, Cuba is firmly of the view that the improper use of the armed forces of a State to commit aggression against another State is not countenanced by this Convention, the purpose of which is specifically to combat one of the most deleterious scourges facing the modern world.</text>
        <text type="para">To condone acts of aggression would effectively mean to condone breaches of international law and the Charter, and to set off conflicts with unpredicatable consequences that would undermine the necessary cohesion of the international community in the fight against the real scourges afflicting the world.</text>
        <text type="para">Moreover, it is the understanding of the Republic of Cuba that the full extent of the provisions of this Convention will apply to the activities conducted by the armed forces of a state against another in the absence of an armed conflict between the two.</text>
        <text type="para">Lastly, Cuba wishes to place on record that a United States naval base is located, against the will of the Cuban people and Government, in the province of Guantanamo, a portion of Cuban territory over which the Cuban State does not exercise its rightful jurisdiction because of the unlawful occupation of such portion of its territory by the United States of America. Consequently, the Government of Cuba assumes no responsibility for that portion of its territory for the purposes of the Treaty, since it does not know whether the United States of America has installed, possesses, maintains or intends to install nuclear material, including nuclear weapons, on that portion of unlawfully occupied Cuban territory.</text>

According to the declaration, the term international humanitarian law is interpreted as only referring to the legal instruments which Turkey is already party to. This interpretation unilaterally alters the definition of international humanitarian law by excluding customary international law from the scope of international humanitarian law.

        <text>The Secretary-General received from the following States, on the date indicated hereinafter, a communication with regard to the reservation made by Egypt upon signature:</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Latvia (6 December 2006): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Government of the Republic of Latvia has examined the reservation made by the Arab Republic of Egypt to the International Convention on the Suppression of the Acts of Nuclear Terrorism upon signature to the Convention regarding Article 4.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Republic of Latvia is of the opinion that this reservation contradicts to the objectives and purposes of the International Convention to suppress the acts of nuclear terrorism wherever and by whomsoever they may be carried out.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Republic of Latvia recalls that customary international law as codified by Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and in particular Article 19 (c), sets out that reservations that are incompatible with the object and purpose of a treaty are not permissible.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Republic of Latvia therefore objects to the aforesaid reservation made by the Arab Republic of Egypt to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</text>
        <text>However, this objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Republic of Latvia and the Arab Republic of Egypt. Thus, the International Convention will become operative without the Arab Republic of Egypt benefiting from its reservation.</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Italy (27 March 2007): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Permanent Mission of Italy has the honor to refer to the reservation made by the Arab Republic of Egypt to article 4 of the Convention, which would extend the application of the Convention to include the armed forces of a State when they "violate the rules and principles of international law in the exercise of their duties." Such activities would otherwise be excluded from the Convention by article 4. It is the opinion of Italy that Egypt cannot unilaterally extend the obligations of the other StatesParties under the Convention, without their express consent, beyond those set out in the Convention.</text>
        <text>Italy wishes to make clear that it does not consent to this expansion of the scope of application of the Convention, and that it does not consider the Egyptian declaration to have any effect on the obligations of Italy under the Convention or on the application of the Convention to the armed forces of Italy.</text>
        <text>Italy thus regards the unilateral declaration made by the Government of Egypt as applying only to the obligations of Egypt under the Convention and only to the armed forces of Egypt."</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Germany (8 February 2008): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>& [the Federal Republic of Germany makes] the following declaration & with regard to the reservation made by the Arab Republic of Egypt upon signature:</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has carefully examined the declaration, described as a reservation, relating to article 4 [paragraph 2 and paragraph 3] of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism made by the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt at the time of its ratification of the Convention.</text>
        <text>In this declaration the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt declares its commitment to article 4 of the Convention provided that the armed forces of a State do not violate the rules and principles of international law in the exercise of their duties under that article, and also provided that the article is not interpreted as excluding the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict from the scope of application of this Convention on the grounds that the activities of States  under certain legal circumstances  are not considered terrorist activities.</text>
        <text>However, article 4, paragraph 2, of the Convention states that the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, as well as the activities undertaken by military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention. Moreover, and according to article 4, paragraph 3, the provisions of article 4, paragraph 2, shall not be interpreted as condoning or making lawful otherwise unlawful acts, or precluding prosecution under other laws. The declaration by the Arab Republic of Egypt thus aims to broaden the scope of the Convention.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is of the opinion that the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt is only entitled to make such a declaration unilaterally for its own armed forces, and it interprets the declaration as having binding effect only on armed forces of the Arab Republic of Egypt. In the view of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, such a unilateral declaration cannot apply to the armed forces of other States Parties without their express consent. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany therefore declares that it does not consent to the Egyptian declaration as so interpreted with regard to any armed forces other than those of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and in particular does not recognize any applicability of the Convention to the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Germany.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany also emphasizes that the declaration by the Arab Republic of Egypt has no effect whatsoever on the Federal Republic of Germanys obligations as State Party to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism or on the Conventions applicability to armed forces of the Federal Republic of Germany.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany regards the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism as entering into force between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Arab Republic of Egypt subject to a unilateral declaration made by the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt, which relates exclusively to the obligations of the Arab Republic of Egypt and to the armed forces of the Arab Republic of Egypt.</text>

Consequently, in keeping with the depositary practice followed in similar cases, the Secretary-General received the reservation in question for deposit.</text>

        <text>The Secretary-General received from the following State, on the date indicated hereinafter, a communication with regard to the declaration and reservation made by Turkey upon signature :</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Latvia (22 December 2006): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Government of the Republic of Latvia has examined the reservation and declaration made by the Republic of Turkey to the International Convention on the Suppression of the Acts of Nuclear Terrorism upon signature to the Convention regarding Article 4 (2).</text>
        <text>The Government of the Republic of Latvia is of the opinion that this declaration is in fact unilateral act that is deemed to limit the scope of the Convention and therefore should be regarded as reservation. Thus, this reservation contradicts to the objectives and purposes of the Convention on the suppression the commitment of the acts of nuclear terrorism wherever and by whomsoever they may be carried out.</text>
        <text>Moreover, the Government of the Republic of Latvia considers that the reservation named as a declaration conflicts with the terms of Article 4 (1).</text>
        <text>Therefore, the Government of the Republic of Latvia is of the opinion that this declaration reservation contradicts to the objectives and purposes of the International Convention to suppress the acts of nuclear terrorism wherever and by whomsoever they might be carried out.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Republic of Latvia recalls that customary international law as codified by Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and in particular Article 19 (c), sets out that reservations that are incompatible with the object and purpose of a treaty are not permissible.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Republic of Latvia therefore objects to the aforesaid reservation named as declaration made by the Republic of Turkey to the International Convention on the Suppression of the Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</text>
        <text>However, this objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Turkey. Thus, the International Convention will become operative without the Republic of Turkey benefiting from its reservation."</text>
