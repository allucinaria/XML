          <Text>At its 635th plenary meeting on 3 September 1992 held in Geneva, the Conference on Disarmament adopted the Report of the &lt;i&gt;Ad Hoc &lt;/i&gt; Committee on Chemical Weapons to the Conference on Disarmament, including the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, contained in the Appendix to the Report. At its 47th session held in New York, the General Assembly, by resolution &lt;a href="/doc/source/docs/A_RES_47_39-E.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;A/RES/47/39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;superscript&gt;1&lt;/superscript&gt; adopted on 30 November 1992, commended the Convention. In the same resolution, the General Assembly also welcomed the invitation of the President of the French Republic to participate in a ceremony to sign the Convention in Paris on 13 January 1993 and requested the Secretary-General, as Depositary of the Convention, to open it for signature in Paris on that date. The Convention was opened for signature in Paris, from 13 January to 15 January 1993. Thereafter, it remained open for signature at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York, until its entry into force, in accordance with article XVIII.</Text>

        <text type="para">Consequently, for the purposes of the Convention, the Government of the Republic of Cuba does not assume any responsibility with respect to the aforesaid territory, since it does not know whether or not the United States has installed, possesses, maintains or intends to possess chemical weapons in the part of Cuban territory that it illegally occupies.</text>

        <text type="para">"The Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of the Islamic principles and beliefs, considers chemical weapons inhuman, and has consistently been on the vanguard of the international efforts to abolish these weapons and prevent their use.</text>
        <text type="para">1. The Islamic Consultative Assembly (the Parliament) of the Islamic Republic of Iran approved the bill presented by the Government to join the [said Convention] on 27 July 1997, and the Guardian Council found the legislation compatible with the Constitution and the Islamic Tenets on 30 July 1997, in accordance with its required Constitutional process. The Islamic Consultative Assembly decided that:</text>
        <text type="para">The Government is hereby authorized, at an appropriate time, to accede to the [said Convention] - as annexed to this legislation and to deposit its relevant instrument.</text>
        <text type="para">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must pursue in all negotiations and within the framework of the Organization of the Convention, the full and indiscriminate implementation of the Convention, particularly in the areas of inspection and transfer of technology and chemicals for peaceful purposes. In case the afore-mentioned requirements are not materialized, upon the recommendation of the Cabinet and approval of the Supreme National Security Council, steps aimed at withdrawing from the Convention will be put in motion.</text>
        <text type="para">2. The Islamic Republic of Iran attaches vital significance to the full, unconditional and indiscriminate implementation of all provisions of the Convention. It reserves the right to withdraw from the Convention under the following circumstances:</text>
        <text type="para">-- non-compliance with the principle of equal treatment of all States Parties in implementation of all relevant provisions of the Convention;</text>
        <text type="para">-- disclosure of its confidential information contrary to the provisions of the Convention;</text>

        <text type="para">3.

The Islamic Republic of Iran rejects any chemical export control mechanism not envisaged in the Convention.</text>
        <text type="para">4. The Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is the sole international authority to determine the compliance of States Parties regarding chemical weapons. Accusations by States Parties against other States Parties in the absence of a determination of non-compliance by OPCW will seriously undermine the Convention and its repetition may make the Convention meaningless.</text>
        <text type="para">5. One of the objectives of the Convention as stipulated in its preamble is to `promote free trade in chemicals as well as international cooperation and exchange of scientific and technical information in the field of chemical activities for purposes not prohibited under the Convention in order to enhance the economic and technological development of all States Parties.' This fundamental objective of the Convention should be respected and embraced by all States Parties to the Convention. Any form of undermining, either in words or in action, of this overriding objective is considered by the Islamic Republic of Iran a grave breach of the provisions of the Convention.</text>
        <text type="para">6. In line with the provisions of the Convention regarding non-discriminatory treatment of States Parties:</text>
        <text type="para">- inspection equipment should be commercially available to all States Parties without condition or limitation.</text>
        <text type="para">- the OPCW should maintain its international character by ensuring fair and balanced geographical distribution of the personnel of its Technical Secretariat, provision of assistance to and cooperation with States Parties, and equitable membership of States Parties in subsidiary organs of the Organization,</text>

        <text>On 26 October 2005, the Secretary-General received from the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland a notification stating that ... the United Kingdoms ratification of the said Convention shall extend to the following territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible: Bailiwick of Guernsey, Bailiwick of Jersey, Isle of Man, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands, St Helena and Dependencies, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Turks and Caicos Islands.</text>
        <text>In this regard, on 14 November 2005, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Argentina, the following communcation:</text>
        <text>In that connection, the Argentine Republic rejects the declaration made by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland extending the territorial scope of the above-mentioned Convention1 to the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands which are an integral part of the Argentine national territory.</text>
        <text>It likewise rejects the British statement insofar as it refers to the intention to apply the said Convention to the so-called British Antarctic Territory and affirms that that statement in no way affects the sovereign rights of the Argentine Republic over the Argentine Antarctic Sector which is an integral part of its national territory. In this connection, it is necessary to bear in mind the terms of article IV of the Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959, to which the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom are party.</text>
        <text>The Argentine Republic also recalls that the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas are an integral part of the Argentine national territory and, since they are being illegally o the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, they form the subject of a sovereignty dispute between both parties, a fact acknowledged by several international bodies.</text>
        <text>On this matter, the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, in which it recognizes the existence of the sovereignty dispute related to the Question of the Malvinas Islands and urges the Governments of the Argentine Republic and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume negotiations with a view to finding a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the dispute as soon as possible. For its part, the Special Committee on Decolonization of the United Nations has repeatedly issued similar calls, most recently through the resolution adopted on 15 June 2005. The General Assembly of the Organization of American States also adopted a further declaration on the question on 7 June 2005.</text>
        <text>Further, on 29 December 2005, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Spain, the following communication with regard to the notification by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the extension of the territorial application of the said Convention to Gibraltar:</text>
        <text>...the Kingdom of Spain considers that such an extension has been made exclusively inasmuch as Gibraltar is a territory for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible and, therefore, falls within the category of "any place under [the] jurisdiction or control [of a State Party]", according to the terminology used in the Convention.</text>
        <text>Therefore, the Kingdom of Spain considers that the circulation of the United Kingdom's notification in the above-mentioned terms does not prejudge in any way either the legal status of the territory nor the sovereignty claims that the Kingdom of Spain consistently maintains with regard to Gibraltar.</text>
        <text>On 27 April 2006, the Secretary-General received from the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the following communication:</text>
        <text>In accordance with instructions received from the Government, I have the honour to refer to the communication dated 30 November 2005 from the Government of Argentina to the United Nations relating to the extension of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and their Destruction, to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the British Antarctic Territory.</text>
        <text>The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are fully entitled to extend the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the British Antarctic Territory.</text>
        <text>The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have no doubts about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the British Antarctic Territory, and their surrounding maritime areas, and reject the claim by the Government of Argentina to soverignty over those islands and areas and that the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are under illegal occupation by the United Kingdom.</text>
