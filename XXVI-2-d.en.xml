        <Participant>Argentina</Participant>
        <text type="title">Interpretative declaration:</text>
        <text type="para">The Argentine Republic declares that there are explosive remnants of war in its territory, in the Malvinas Islands.</text>
        <text type="para">Since this part of Argentine territory is illegally occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Argentine Republic is prevented from accessing these explosive remnants of war with a view to their removal and destruction.</text>
        <text type="para">The United Nations General Assembly has recognized the existence of a sovereignty dispute concerning the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and has urged the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to continue negotiations in order to find a peaceful and definitive solution to the dispute as soon as possible, through the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is to report to the General Assembly on the progress made (resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25). The Special Committee on decolonization has expressed the same opinion: it has adopted a resolution each year stating that the way to end this colonial situation is to find a definitive solution to the sovereignty dispute in a peaceful and negotiated manner and requesting the two Governments to resume negotiations to this end.</text>
        <text type="para">The Argentine Republic reaffirms its sovereign rights over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas, which are an integral part of its national territory.</text>

      <Declaration>
        <Participant>Holy See</Participant>
        <text type="title">Declaration :</text>
        <text type="para">In acceding to the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) annexed to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (CCW), adopted on November 28, 2003, at the meeting of the States Parties to the CCW, the Holy See, as it did on June 16, 1997 when it acceded to the Convention and its first four Protocols, "in keeping with its proper nature and with the particular condition of Vatican City State, intends to renew its encouragement to the International Community to continue on the path it has taken for the reduction of human suffering caused by armed conflict".</text>
        <text type="para">With the approval of the fifth Protocol, the CCW is confirmed as a "forward-looking living instrument"of international humanitarian law, intended to address the problems arising from modern armed conflicts and to improve its effectiveness for the protection of civilians and combatants in such situations. Although one could have wished for a greater incisiveness in the Protocol in responding to the problems originating from the ERW, the adoption of this instrument represents an important multilateral tool for the control of arms for humanitarian reasons, capable of calling States to responsibility for eh ERW and for damages caused by them.</text>
        <text type="para">In keeping with it own commitment to encouraging the development and implementation of humanitarian law on the part of all States and in all circumstances, the Holy See is convinced that the Fifth Protocol signifies a concretely promoting the culture of life and of peace, based upon the dignity of the human person and the primacy of the rule of law, through a responsible, hones and consistent cooperation of all the members of the community of nations.</text>
