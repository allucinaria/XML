        <text type="para">2 (a) Without prejudice to paragraph (b) of this reserva- tion, article 2 of the Code of Conduct shall not be applied in conference trades between the Member States of the Community and, on a reciprocal basis, between such States and the other OECD countries which are parties to the Code.</text>
        <text type="para">(b) The text of paragraph (a) shall not affect the opportunities for participation as third country shipping lines in such trades, in accordance with the principles reflected in article 2 of the Code, of the shipping lines of a developing country which are recognized as national shipping lines under the Code and which are:</text>
        <text type="para">(i) Already members of a conference serving these trade; or</text>
        <text type="para">(ii) Admitted to such a conference under article 1 (3) of the Code.</text>

Articles 3 and 14 (9) of the Code of Conduct shall not be applied in conference trades between the Member States of the Community and, on a reciprocal basis, between such States and the other OECD countries which are parties to the Code. In trades to which Article 3 of the Code of Conduct applies, the last sentence of that Article is interpreted as meaning that:</text>
        <text type="para">- The two groups of national shipping lines will co-ordinate their positions before voting on matters concerning the trade between their two countries;</text>
        <text type="para">- This sentence applies solely to matters which the conference agreement identifies as requiring the assent of both groups of national shipping lines concerned, and not to all matters covered by the conference agreement.</text>
        <text type="para">B. &lt;i&gt; Declarations: &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text type="para">1. The Government of Portugal considers that the UnitedNations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences affords the shipping lines of developing countries extended opportunitieso participate in the conference system and is drafted so as to regulate conferences and their activities in open trades. The Government also considers that it is essential for the functioning of the Code and conferences subject thereto that opportunities for fair competition on a commercial basis by non-conference shipping lines continue to exist and that shippers are not denied an option in the choice between conference shipping lines and non-conference shipping lines, subject to loyalty arrangements where they exist. These basic concepts are reflected in a number of provisions of the Code itself, including its objectives and principles, and they are expressly set out in Resolution No. 2 on non-conference shipping lines adopted by the UnitedNations Conference of Plenipotentiaries.</text>
        <text type="para">2. The Government considers furthermore that any regulations or other measures adopted by a Contracting Party to the Convention with the aim or effect of eliminating such opportu- nities for competition by non-conference shipping lines would be inconsistent with the above-mentioned basic concepts and would bring about a radical change in the circumstances in which conferences subject to the Code are envisaged as operating. Nothing in the Convention obliges other Contracting Parties to accept either the validity of such regulations or measures or situations where conferences, by virtue of such regulations or measures, acquire effective monopoly in trades subject to the Code.</text>
        <text type="para">3. The Government of Portugal declares that it will implement the Convention in accordance with the basic concepts and considerations herein stated and, in so doing, is not precluded by the Convention from taking appropriate steps in the event that another Contracting Party adopts measures or practices that prevent fair competition on a commercial basis in its liner trade.</text>

        <text type="title">Dclaration:</text>
        <text type="para">A. The Government of Spain considers that the UnitedNations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences provides the shipping lines of developing countries with ample opportunities to participate in the liner conference system, and that it has been drafted in such a manner as to regulate conferences and their activities within a system of free trade (where there are opportunities for non-conference shipping lines).</text>
        <text type="para">This Government also deems it essential to the functioning of the Code and of the conferences whose regulation is referred to that there should continue to be opportunities for fair competition on a commercial basis for non-conference shipping lines, and that shippers should not be denied an option in the choice between conference shipping lines and non-conference shipping lines, subject to any loyalty arrangements where they exist. These basic concepts are reflected in several provisions of the Code itself, including its objectives and principles, and are expressly set out in resolution No. 2, concerning non-conference shipping lines, adopted by the UnitedNations Conference of Plenipotentiaries.</text>
        <text type="para">B. This Government further believes that any regulation or other measures adopted by a Contracting Party to the UnitedNations Convention and having the purpose or effect of eliminating such opportunities for competition for non-conference shipping lines would be incompatible with the basic concepts mentioned above, and would effect a radical change in the circumstances under which conferences subject to the Code are envisaged as operative. Nothing in the Convention requires other Contracting Parties to accept either the validity of such regulations, or measures or situations whereby conferences, through such regulations or measures, would, in practice, acquire a monopoly on trades subject to the Code.</text>
        <text type="para">C. The Government of Spain declares that it will implement the Convention in accordance with the basic concepts and conns stipulatein and that, accordingly, the Convention shall not prevent it from taking appropriate steps in the event that another Contracting Party adopts measures or practices which impede fair competition on a commercial basis in liner shipping service.</text>

        <text>On 6 and 10 June 1997, the Secretary-General received communications concerning the status of Hong Kong from the Governments of the United Kingdom and China (see also note 2 under "China" and note 2 under "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" regarding Hong Kong in the "Historical Information" section in the front matter of this volume).

        <text>(B) Paragraph 1 (A) above shall not affect the opportunity of shipping lines of a developing country for participation as third country shipping lines in such trades in accordance with the principles reflected in article 2 of the Convention, or the shipping lines of a developing country which are recognised as national shipping lines under the Convention and which are:</text>
        <text>(a) Already members of a conference serving these trades: or</text>
        <text>(b) Admitted to such a conference under article 1(3) of the Convention.</text>
        <text>2. In trades where article 2 of the Convention applies, shipping lines incorporated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will, subject to reciprocity, allow participation in redistribution by lines from any country which has agreed to allow participation by lines of the People's Republic of China in redistribution in respect of its trades.</text>
        <text>3. Article 3 and article 14 (9) of the Convention shall not be applied in conference trades, on a reciprocal basis, betweenhe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and any State which has made a reservation disapplying article 3 and article 14 (9) in respect of its trade with the People's Republic of China.</text>
        <text>4. In trade to which article 3 of the Convention applies, the last sentence of that article is interpreted as meaning that:</text>
