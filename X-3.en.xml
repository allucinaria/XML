        <text type="title">Declaration and reservation made upon signature and confirmed upon ratification:</text>
        <text type="para">The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic considers it necessary to draw attention to the discriminatory nature of articles 17, 19, 22 and 23 of the Convention, under which a number of States are deprived of the opportunity to become Parties to the Convention. The Convention deals with matters that affect the interests of all States, and it should therefore be open for participation by all States. According to the principle of sovereign equality, no States have the right to exclude other States from participation in a Convention of this type.</text>
        <text type="para">The Government of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic does not consider itself bound by the provisions of article 16 of the Convention on Transit Trade of Land-locked States, under which members of the arbitration commission may be appointed by the President of the International Court of Justice, and declares that, in each individual case, the consent of the contending States is necessary for the appointment of members of the arbitration commission by the President of the International Court of Justice.</text>

        <text type="title">Declaration made upon signature and confirmed upon ratifica- tion:</text>
        <text type="para">1. With regard to the application of article 3 of the Conven- tion, the Belgian Government considers that the exemption relates exclusively to duties or taxes on imports or exports, and not to taxes on transactions, such as the Belgian tax on transport and auxiliary services, which also apply to internal trade.</text>
        <text type="para">2. Belgium can apply article 4, paragraph 1, only in so far as State-owned means of transport and handling equipment are concerned.</text>
        <text type="title">Upon signature (the reservation referred to below was not made upon ratification):</text>
        <text type="para">3. The Belgian Government intends, upon depositing its instrument of ratification of the Convention, to make a reserva- tion concerning the rights and obligations of Belgium arising from its adherence to certain international treaties relating to economic matters or trade.</text>
