        <Participant>Argentina</Participant>
        <text type="title">Declaration:</text>
        <text type="para">With reference to article 2, the Argentine Republic would prefer a broader definition of sale of children, as set out in the Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors which Argentina has ratified and which, in its article 2, expressly defines traffic as the abduction, removal or retention, or attempted abduction, removal or retention, of a minor for unlawful purposes or by unlawful means. Therefore, under article 41 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, this meaning shall continue to apply. For the same reasons, the Argentine Republic believes that the sale of children should be criminalized in all cases and not only in those enumerated in article 3, paragraph 1 (a).</text>
        <text type="para">Concerning article 3, the Argentine Republic further states that it has not signed international instruments on the international adoption of minors, has entered a reservation in respect of subparagraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child dealing with international adoption, and does not permit international adoption of children domiciled or resident in its jurisdiction.</text>
        <text type="para">Concerning article 7, the Argentine Republic construes the term 'confiscation' (confiscación) to mean the seizure of goods and proceeds as part of a sentence or penalty (decomisar).*</text>
        <text type="para">&lt;i&gt;*Translator's note: The meaning of the Spanish term "decomisar" is not as broad as the English "seizure". "Decomisar" means "seizure" during the sentencing or penalty phase only. (Seizure as a preventive measure is rendered with "incautación".) &lt;/i&gt;</text>

Such admission shall not be forced or coerced.</text>

        <text type="para">"The Government of Sweden has examined the declaration made by Turkey upon ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.</text>
        <text type="para">The declaration states that Turkey will implement the provisions of the Optional Protocol only to the States Parties which it recognises and with which it has diplomatic relations. This statement in fact amounts, in the view of the Government of Sweden, to a reservation. The reservation makes it unclear to what extent Turkey considers itself bound by the obligations of the Optional Protocol. In absence of further clarification, therefore, the reservation raises doubt as to the commitment of Turkey to the object and purpose of the Optional Protocol.</text>

        <text>With regard to the reservation made by Qatar upon accession, the Secretary-General received the following communication on the date indicated hereinafter:</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Ireland (6 January 2003): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Government of Ireland have examined the reservation to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography made by the Government of Qatar at the time of its accession to the Optional Protocol.</text>
        <text>The Government of Ireland are of the view that this reservation refers in a general manner to Islamic law without precising its content and therefore leaves other states parties in doubt as to the real extent of the state of Qatars commitment to the Optional Protocol. It is in the common interest of States that treaties to which they have chosen to become parties are respected as to their object and purpose, by all parties, and that States are prepared to undertake any legislative changes necessary to comply with their obligations under the treaties.</text>
        <text>For these reasons, the Government of Ireland object to this reservation made by the Government of Qatar.</text>
        <text>This position, however, does not preclude the entry into force in its entirety of the Optional Protocol between Qatar and Ireland."</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Finland (10 March 2003): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Government of Finland has carefully examined the contents of the reservation made by the Government of Qatar to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.</text>
        <text>The Government of Finland notes that the reservation made by Qatar which consists of a general reference to religious law without specifying its contents does not clearly define the extent to which Qatar commits itself to the Protocol and therefore creates serious doubts as to its commitment to fulfil its obligations under the Protocol. Such a reservation is subject to the general principle of treaty interpretation according to which a party manot invoke the provisions of its domestic law as justification for a failure to perform its treaty obligations.</text>
        <text>The Government of Finland also notes that the reservation of Qatar, being of too general a nature, raises doubts as to the full commitment of Qatar to the object and purpose of the Protocol, and wishes to recall that, according to the customary international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties, a reservation incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention shall not be permitted.</text>
        <text>The Government of Finland therefore objects to the reservation made by the Government of Qatar to the Protocol."</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Netherlands (7 April 2003): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has examined the reservation made by the Government of Qatar at the time of its accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the rights of the child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands considers that the reservation concerning the national law of Qatar, which seeks to limit the responsibilities of the reserving State under the Protocol by invoking national law, may raise doubts as to the commitment of this State to the object and purpose of the Convention and, moreover, contribute to undermining the basis of international treaty law.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands recalls that, according to paragraph 2 of article 28 of the Convention, a reservation incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention shall not be permitted.</text>
        <text>It is in the common interest of States that treaties to which they have chosen to become party are respected, as to their object and purpose, by all parties and that States are prepared to undertake any legislative changes necessary to comply with their obligations under the treaties.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands therefore objects to the aforesaid reservation made by the Government of Qatarto the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the rights of the child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.</text>
        <text>This objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Qatar."</text>
