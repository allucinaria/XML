        <text>The German Democratic Republic had acceded to the Convention on 9 September 1987 with the following reservation:</text>
        <text>1. While acceding to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963 the German Democratic Republic reserves itself the right, in accordance with Article 73 of the Convention, to conclude agreements with other States-parties in order to supplement and complete the provisions as regards bilateral relations. This concerns, in particular, the status, privileges and immunities of independent consular missions and their members as well as the consular tasks.</text>
        <text>2. The German Democratic Republic holds the opinion that the provisions of Articles 74 and 76 of the Convention are in contradiction to the principle according to which all states that are guided in their policy by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter have the right to accede to conventions affecting the interests of all states.</text>

        <text>In a communication received on 16 March 1966, the Government of Israel declared that it "has noted the political character of paragraph 1 of the declaration made by the Government of the United Arab Republic [see also note 1 under United Arab Republic (Egypt and Syria) in the Historical Information section in the front matter of this volume and note 13 in this chapter]. In the view of the Government of Israel, the Convention and Protocol are not the proper place for making such political pronouncements. The Government of Israel will, in so far as concerns the substance of the matter, adopt towards the Government of the United Arab Republic an attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>

        <text>In a communication received by the Secretary-General on 12 May 1977 the Government of Israel made the following declaration:</text>
        <text>"The instrument deposited by the Government of Morocco contains a statement of a political character in respect to Israel. In the view of the Government of Israel, this is not the proper place for making such political pronouncements which are, moreover, in flagrant contradiction to the principles, objects and purposes of the Organization. That pronouncement by the Government of Morocco cannot in any way affect whatever obligations are binding upon Morocco under general international law or under particular treaties.</text>
        <text>"The Government of Israel will, insofar as concerns the substance of the matter, adopt towards the Government of Morocco an attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>

        <text>In regard to the reservations made by Qatar upon accession, the Secretary-General received communications from the following States on the dates indicated hereinafter:</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Finland (17 March 2000) &lt;/i&gt;:</text>
        <text>The Government of Finland Notes that the inviolability of the official correspondence between the Sending State and the consular post can be considered one of the main objects of the Convention. As Qatar reserves the right to open a consular bag without a prior consent by the Sending State, it is the view of the Government of Finland that the above-mentioned reservation to Article 35 is in clear contradiction with the object and purpose of the Convention.</text>
        <text>According to the reservation to Article 46, para. 1, Qatar reserves the right to subject those consular employees who are engaged in administrative tasks or the members of their families to registration of aliens and residence permits. Para. 2 of Article?6 contains an exhaustive list of persons who are not exempt from the requirement of registration of aliens and residence permits. Given that the consular employees who are engaged in administrative tasks or the members of their families are covered by Article 46 para. 1, and as they are not included in the list of para. 2 of the same article, it is the opinion of the Government of Finland that the reservation is not in conformity with Article 46, nor with the object and purpose of the Convention.</text>
        <text>The Government of Finland therefore objects to the reservation made by the Government of Qatar to the said Convention. This objection does not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between Qatar and Finland. The Convention will thus become operative between the two states without Qatar benefitting from the reservation".</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Netherlands (17 July 2000) &lt;/i&gt;:</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands objects to the reservation made by the Government of Qatar in relation to article 35, paragraph 3, of the said Convention.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdome Netherlands Notes that the inviolability of the consular bag constitutes an important element of the Convention and any reservation intended to allow a receiving State to open the consular bag without the approval of the sending State is not only in contradiction with the very language of article 35, paragraph 3, of the Convention but also with customary international law.</text>
        <text>Furthermore, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands objects to the reservation made by the Government of Qatar in relation to Article 46, paragraph 1, of the said Convention.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Notes that Article 46, paragraph 2, contains an exhaustive list of persons who are not exempt from the requirement of registration of aliens and residence permits. Given that the consular employees who are engaged in administrative tasks or the members of their families are covered by Article 46, paragraph 1, and are not included in the aforesaid list, the reservation concerning article 46, paragraph 1, is not in conformity with paragraph 2 of the same article, nor with the object and purpose of the Convention.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands therefore objects to the aforesaid reservations made by the Government of Qatar. These objections shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Qatar."</text>

        <text>In regard to the objection made by the Government of Netherlands 5 December 1986 to the reservation made by the Yemen Arab Repuiblic, the Secretary-General received, on 28 May 1987, from the Government of Yemen the following communication:</text>
        <text>[The Government of Yemen] should like to make clear in this connection that it was our country's intention in making that reservation that the expression "family of a member of the consular post" should, for the purposes of enjoyment of the privileges and immunities specified in the Convention, be understood to mean the member of the consular post, his spouse and minor children only.</text>
        <text>[The Government of Yemen] should like to make it clear that this reservation is not intended to exclude the husbands of female members of the consular posts, as was suggested in the Netherlands interpretation, since it is natural that husbands should in such cases enjoy the same privileges and immunities.</text>
