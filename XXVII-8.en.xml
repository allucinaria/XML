Likewise, the definitions contained in article 2 and other provisions of the Convention indicate that the terms "genetic resources", "biological resources" and "biological material" do not include the human genome. In accordance with the commitments entered into in the Convention, the Argentine Nation will pass legislation on the conditions of access to biological resources and the ownership of future rights and benefits arising from them. The Convention is fully consistent with the principles established in the "Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights", including trade in counterfeit goods, contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of GATT.</text>

        <text>The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland considers the extension of the Convention to South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands to enter into force from the day of deposit of this notification ..."</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>On 14 July 2015, the Secretary-General received the following communication:</text>
        <text>Upon instructions from my Government, I have the honor to address you, in your capacity as depositary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, in order to refer to the note sent to you by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 27 March 2015 regarding the attempt of that country to apply the Convention to the South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands.</text>
        <text>The Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas, are integral part of the national territory of the Argentine Republic and, being illegitimately occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, are subject to a sovereignty dispute recognized by the United Nations and other international fora and organizations.</text>
        <text>The illegitimate occupation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland led the United Nations General Assembly to adopt resolutions 2065(XX), 3169 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, in which it recognized the existence of a sovereignty dispute regarding the question of the Malvinas islands and calls on the Governments of the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume negotiations with a view to finding, as soon as possible, a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the dispute. The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization has made repeated statements to the same effect, the most recently by means of the resolution adopted on 25 June 2015. </text>
        <text>Therefore, the Argentine Republic objects and rejects the attempt of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to apply the Convention on Biological Diversity to the South Georgias and South Sandwich lslands.</text>
        <text>The Argentine Republic recalls that the Convention, adopted in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992, is applicable to the Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands because they are integral part of the territory of the Argentine Republic, as a result of the ratification made by the Argentine Government on 22 November 1994.</text>
        <text>The Argentine Republic reaffirms its sovereignty rights over the Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.</text>
        <text>The Argentine Republic should be grateful if you, acting as a depositary of the Convention, would register this statement, notify the Parties and Contracting Parties and distribute it as document of the Organization among its Member States.</text>

        <text>On 9 July 2014, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Spain the following communication with regard to the Territorial Application by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to Gibraltar:</text>
        <text>1. Gibraltar is a Non-Self-Governing Territory for whose international relations the Government of the United Kingdom is responsible and which is subject to a process of decolonization in accordance with the relevant decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly.</text>
        <text>2.

        <text>3. Consequently, any involvement by the Gibraltarian authorities in the implementation of this Convention shall be understood to take place exclusively within the framework of the internal affairs of Gibraltar and shall not be considered to affect in any way the content of the two preceding paragraphs.</text>
        <text>4.
