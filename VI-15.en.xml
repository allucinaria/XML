        <text type="para">The Government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic will not consider itself bound by the provisions of article 12, paragraphs 2 and 3; article 13, paragraph 2; article 14, paragraphs 1 and 2; and article 31, paragraph 1 (b) of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs as applied to States not entitled to become Parties to the Single Convention on the basis of the procedure provided for in article 40 of that Convention.</text>
        <text type="para">The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic deems it essential to draw attention to the discriminatory character of article 40, paragraph 1, of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, under the terms of which certain States are not entitled to become Parties to the said Convention. The Single Convention concerns matters which are of interest to all States and has as its objective the enlistment of the efforts of all countries in the struggle against the social evil of the abuse of narcotics. The Convention should therefore be open to all countries. According to the principle of the sovereign equality of States, no States have the right to deny to other countries the possibility of participating in a Convention of this type.</text>
