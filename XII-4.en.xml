          <Text>The Convention was prepared by the Sub-Committee on Inland Water Transport of the Inland Transport Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and its subsidiary bodies (Working Party on River Law and Groups of Rapporteurs). The Inland Transport Committee, at its twenty-first session held from 20 to 24 January 1964, decided that the question of the opening of the Convention for signature should be settled by the Sub-Committee on Inland Water Transport at its next session (see Report of the Inland Transport Committee on its twenty-third session, document E/ECE/TRANS/535, paragraph 52). The decision to open the Convention for signature was taken by the said Sub-Committee at its eighth session held from 28 to 30 October 1964 (see document TRANS/291, paragraph 17).</Text>
