In the absence of further clarification, this reservation does not clearly specify the extent of El Salvadors derogation from the provisions of the Convention. This general and vague wording of the reservation raises doubts as to the degree of commitment assumed by El Salvador in becoming a party to the Convention and is therefore incompatible with international law.</text>

        <text type="title">With regard to the declaration made by Turkey upon ratification:</text>
        <text type="para">The Republic of Cyprus has examined the declaration deposited by the Republic of Turkey upon ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (New York, 13 December 2006) on 26 March 2015, limiting the implementation of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocol, by excluding the Republic of Cyprus from the application of the Protocol at reference by the Republic of Turkey. The content of the declaration makes it tantamount in its essence to a reservation. Such a reservation is contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention and its Protocol, as it prevents the realization of the cooperation between States Parties foreseen by the Convention and its Protocol. In addition, such a declaration / reservation also relies on the principle of reciprocity, which is incompatible with human rights obligations assumed through this Convention. The legal reasoning, cited above, renders Turkeys declaration unacceptable, as the declaration under reference contravenes the letter and the spirit of the Convention and its Protocol. The Republic of Cyprus, therefore, objects to the aforesaid declaration made by the Republic of Turkey and considers the declaration null and void. This objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention, in its entirety, between the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Turkey, without the Republic of Turkey benefiting from its declaration / reservation.</text>

        <text>On 28 January 2010, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Germany the following communication relating to the declaration made by the Republic of El Salvador upon signature and confirmed upon ratification:</text>
        <text>The Federal Republic of Germany has carefully examined the aforementioned reservation.</text>
        <text>The Federal Republic of Germany is of the opinion that reservations which consist in a general reference to a system of norms (like the constitution or the legal order of the reserving State) without specifying the contents thereof leave it uncertain to which extent that State accepts to be bound by the obligations under the treaty. Moreover, those norms may be subject to changes.</text>
        <text>The reservation made by the Republic of El Salvador is therefore not sufficiently precise to make it possible to determine the restrictions that are introduced into the agreement.</text>
        <text>The Federal Republic of Germany is therefore of the opinion that the reservation is incompatible with object and purpose of the Convention and the Protocol and would like to recall that, according to Article 46, paragraph 1 of the Convention, and Article 14, paragraph 1 of the Protocol, a reservation incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention shall not be permitted.</text>
        <text>The Federal Republic of Germany therefore objects to the above-mentioned reservation. This objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention and the Protocol between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of El Salvador.</text>

        <text>The Government of the Portuguese Republic has examined the declaration made by the Republic of Turkey upon ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted on 13 December 2006.</text>
        <text>It welcomes the ratification of the Optional Protocol by the Republic of Turkey since this is a significant step for the promotion of human rights, particularly the rights of those persons with disabilities.</text>
        <text>Nevertheless, the Portuguese Republic, as a European Union Member State, opposes the declaration made by the Republic of Turkey since it describes another Member State, the Republic of Cyprus, as a defunct entity.</text>
