        <text>Subsequently, on 3 June 1993, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified the Secretary-General that the Convention shall extend to Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Antarctic Territory, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.</text>
        <text>In this regard, on 4 February 1994, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Argentina the following declaration:</text>
        <text>The Argentine Republic rejects the extension by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the application of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, signed at Vienna on 21February 1971, to the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and reaffirms its sovereignty over these islands, which are an integral part of the national territory.</text>
        <text>Subsequently, on 4 January 1995, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified the Secretary-General of the following:</text>
        <text>"The British Government have no doubt about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, as well as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and have no doubt, therefore, about their right to extend the said Convention to these territories. The British Government can only reject as unfounded the claim by the Government of Argentina that these Islands are a part of Argentine territory."</text>
        <text>Further, in a communication received on 25 November 2002, the Government of the United Kingdom informed the Secreary-Genel that the Convention would also apply to the Isle of Man. The Government of the United Kingdom further declared that:</text>

        <text>In this regard, on 20 February 2003, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Argentina, the following communication:</text>
        <text>The Argentine Republic reiterates what was stated in its note of 4 February 1994, by which it rejected the declaration of territorial application of the above-mentioned Convention made on 3 June 1993 by the United Kingdom in respect of the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which are an integral part of the national territory of Argentina. It also rejects the declaration of the United Kingdom purporting to extend the application of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances to the sector which it refers to as "British Antarctic Territory" and affirms that this declaration in no way affects the rights of sovereignty of the Argentine Republic over the Argentine Antarctic Sector.</text>
        <text>Furthermore, the Argentine Republic rejects the declaration made by the United Kingdom in its note of 3 December 2002 and any other document, act or activity and their effects, which might arise from that declaration and from the purported territorial application, as well as the designation of these territories as dependencies of the United Kingdom.</text>
        <text>The United Nations General Assembly adopted resolutions 2065?XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, in which it recognizes the existence of the sovereignty dispute relating to the question of the Malvinas Islands urges the Governments of the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom to resume negotiations in order to find as soon as possible a peaceful and definitive settlement of the dispute, using the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was requested to report to the General Assembly on the progress made.</text>
        <text>The Argentine Republic reaffirms its sovereign rights over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands as well as the surrounding maritime areas, which are part of its national territory. It also reaffirms its rights of sovereignty over the Argentine Antarctic Sector and the validity of the Antarctic Treaty, signed in Washington on 1 December 1959.</text>
        <text>The Argentine Government requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to notify Contracting States and States Parties to the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of this communication. It further requests the Secretary-General to bring this communication to the attention of the International Narcotics Control Board.</text>
        <text>On 11 April 2003: in respect of Jersey with the following declaration:</text>
        <text>"In accordance with Article 28 thereof, I further declare that Jersey is a separate region for the purposes of the Convention."</text>

        <text>With respect to the Kuwaiti declaration, the Secretary-General received on 29 October 1979 from the Government of Israel the following communications:</text>
        <text>"The Government of the State of Israel has noted the political character of the statement made by the Government of Kuwait. In the view of the Government of the State of Israel, this Convention is not the proper place for making such political pronouncements. Moreover, the said declaration cannot in any way affect whatever obligations are binding upon Kuwait under general international law or under particular conventions. The Government of the State of Israel will, in so far as concerns the substance of the matter, adopt towards the Government of Kuwait an attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>
        <text>Subsequently, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Israel an objection, identical in essence, &lt;i&gt;mutatis mutandis &lt;/i&gt;, with regard to a reservation made by Bahrain.</text>

        <text>"The reservation referred to was motivated by the following two wild plant species: Ayahuasca, a liana which grows in the Amazon region and which contains the active element N, N-dimethyltryptamine, and a columnar cactus known as San Pedro, which grows in the desert coastal regions and in the Andean region and contains mescaline. Ayahuasca is used by certain Amazon ethnic groups in magical and religious rites and in rites of initiation into adulthood; San Pedro is used in magical rites by indigenous medicine men or shamans. Because of their psychotropic content, both plant species are included in the reservation option made possible by article 32, paragraph 4, of the Convention.</text>
