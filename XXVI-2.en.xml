        <text type="para">(c) The phrase 'similar functions' used in article 8, includes the concepts of `peace-making, preventive peace-keeping and peace enforcement' as defined in an agenda for peace (United Nations document A/47/277 S/2411 of 17 June 1992).</text>
        <text type="para">4.

        <text type="para">&lt;i&gt;Statement:&lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text type="para">1. The Government of the People's Republic of China has decided to sign the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects adopted at the United Nations Conference held in Gene- va on 10 October 1980.</text>
        <text type="para">2. The Government of the People's Republic of China deems that the basic spirit of the Convention reflects the reasonable demand and good intention of numerous countries and peoples of the world regarding prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which are excessively in- jurious or have indiscriminate effects. This basic spirit con- forms to China's consistent position and serves the interest of opposing aggression and maintaining peace.</text>
        <text type="para">3. However, it should be pointed out that the Convention fails to provide for supervision or verification of any violation of its clauses, thus weakening its binding force. The Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other Devices fails to lay down strict restrictions on the use of such weapons by the aggressor on the territory of his victim and to provide adequately for the right of a state victim of an aggression to defend itself by all necessary means. The Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons does not stipulate restrictions on the use of such weapons against combat personnel. Furthermore, the Chinese texts of the Convention and Protocol are not accurate or satisfactory enough. It is the hope of the Chinese Government that these inadequacies can be remedied in due course.</text>

Our signature of this Convention reflects the general willingness of the United States to adopt practical and reasonable provisions concerning the conduct of military operations, for the purpose of protecting noncombatants.</text>
        <text type="para">"At the same time, we want to emphasize that formal adherence by States to agreements restricting the use of weapons in armed conflict would be of little purpose if the parties were not firmly committed to taking every appropriate step to ensure compliance with those restrictions after their entry into force. It would be the firm intention of the United States and, we trust, all other parties to utilize the procedures and remedies provided by this Convention, and by the general laws of war, to see to it that all parties to the Convention meet their obligations under it. The United States strongly supported proposals by other countries during the Conference to include special procedures for dealing with compliance matters, and reserves the right to propose at a later date additional procedures and remedies, should this prove necessary, to deal with such problems.</text>

        <text type="para">"The Government of Finland has carefully examined the reservation and the text of Article 2, paragraphs 2 and 3, and wishes to express its concerns with respect to the reservation.</text>
        <text type="para">Under Article 2, paragraph 2, it is prohibited in all circumstances to make any military objective located within a concentration of civilians the object of attack by air-delivered incendiary weapons. Furthermore, under Article 2, paragraph 3, it is further prohibited to make any military objective located within a concentration of civilians the object of attack by means of incendiary weapons other than air-delivered incendiary weapons, except when such military objective is clearly separated from the concentration of civilians and all feasible precautions are taken with a view to limiting the incendiary effects to the military objective and to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.</text>
        <text type="para">Article 2, paragraph 2, allows no exceptions concerning the use of air-delivered incendiary weapons. Therefore, the reservation made by the United States of America in respect of that provision appears to undermine the object and purpose of Protocol III. Furthermore, Article 2, paragraph 3, provides for two conditions for the use of incendiary weapons other than air-delivered ones, both of which have to be met. While noting that the reservation made by the United States of America respects the condition of all feasible precautions, the Government of Finland considers that it fails to take account of the condition that the military objective must be clearly separated from the concentration of civilians. Article 2 does not provide for any exception to this condition. Therefore, the reservation appears to run counter to the object and purpose of the Protocol also in respect of paragraph 3 of Article 2.</text>
        <text type="para">Protocol III does not expressly prohibit reservations. However, a reservation should not undermine the object and purpose of the treaty in question. The reservation made by the United States of America appears to undermine the core purpose of Protocol III, that is the protection of civilians.</text>

        <text type="para">According to customary international law, as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, reservations incompatible with the object and purpose of a treaty shall not be permitted. It is in the common interest of all States that treaties to which they have chosen to become parties are respected as to their object and purpose by all parties, and that States are prepared to undertake any legislative changes necessary to fulfill their obligations under the treaties.</text>
        <text type="para">The Government of Sweden notes that the United States of America has made a reservation to the core provisions of Protocol III.</text>
        <text type="para">The Protocol provides (Article 2.2) that it is prohibited in all circumstances to make any military objective located within a concentration of civilians the object of attack by air-delivered incendiary weapons. This is a clear-cut ban on the use of air-delivered incendiary weapons. The provision does not allow for any exceptions.</text>
        <text type="para">The formulation of the United States of America that it reserves the right to use incendiary weapons against military objectives located in concentrations of civilians where it is judged that such use would cause fewer casualties and/or less collateral damage than alternative weapons, but in so doing will take all feasible precautions with a view to limiting the incendiary effects to the military objective and to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects seems to open for an interpretation that air-delivered incendiary weapons could be used under certain conditions also when military objectives are located within concentrations of civilians. Such an interpretation is neither consistent with the wording of the treaty, nor with the object and purpose of the treaty.</text>
        <text type="para">Article 2.3 of the Protocol prohibits the use of attacks by means of incendiary weapons other than air-delivered weapons located within a concentration of civilians. This is the main rule. There is an exception to this main rule and the parameters of the exception are clearly set out in the Article. An attack against a military objective that is clearly separated from the concentration of civilians and where all feasible precautions are taken with a view to limiting the incendiary effects to the military objective and to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects is not prohibited under the Protocol.</text>
        <text type="para">The reservation of the United States appears to disregard the fact that incendiary weapons may only be used under these circumstances. It is, for example, not possible to neglect the requirement that the military objective must be clearly separated from the concentration of civilians.</text>
        <text type="para">Hence, this reservation is contrary to the obligation contained in Article 2.3 and inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty.</text>
        <text type="para">It should be underlined that all States are under an obligation to take feasible precautions before an attack. This follows from customary law and from treaty provisions, including Article 2.3 of the Protocol on incendiary weapons. The duty to take feasible precautions does not remove the obligation to ensure that specific treaty obligations are fulfilled, such as the obligation to ensure that the military objective is clearly separated which goes to the heart of the object and purpose of the treaty.</text>
        <text type="para">The reservation of the United States of America concern the core provisions of the Protocol and must therefore also be regarded as incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.</text>

        <text type="para">Upon depositing the instrument of ratification of Protocol III to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons on 21 January 2009, the United States of America made a reservation with reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 2 of the said Protocol. According to the reservation, the United States reserve the right to use incendiary weapons against military objectives located in concentrations of civilians where it is judged that such use would cause fewer casualties and/or less collateral damage than alternative weapons, but in so doing will take all feasible precautions with a view to limiting the incendiary effects to the military objective and to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.</text>
        <text type="para">Switzerland appreciates the willingness expressed by the United States to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and individual civilians not directly participating in hostilities. Switzerland considers that these measures are in keeping with the fundamental principle of distinction under international humanitarian law, a principle that is enshrined, in particular, in articles 57 (2) (ii) and 57 (4) of the first 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. These provisions require each party to a conflict to take all reasonable precautions to avoid losses of civilian lives and damage to civilian objects.</text>
        <text type="para">Nonetheless, Switzerland considers that the reservation made by the United States is incompatible with the object and purpose of Protocol III, and therefore it objects to the reservation for the following reasons: in Switzerlands view, paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 2 are core provisions that set out an absolute prohibition of the use of air-delivered incendiary weapons against military objectives located within concentrations of civilians (paragraph 2) and of attacks by means of incendiary weapons other than air-delivered incendiary weapons, except when such military objective is clearly separated from the concentration of civilians (paragraph 3). These provisions were designed as specific rules that replace and strengthen the general customary and treaty obligations arising from international humanitarian law for the purpose of guaranteeing the full protection of civilians from incendiary weapons. The reservation made by the United States does not take into consideration the specific nature of paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 2.</text>
        <text type="para">Switzerland considers that this objection does not constitute an obstacle to the entry into force of Protocol III as between Switzerland and the United States of America.</text>

On this reading, the United Kingdom objects to the reservation as contrary to the object and purpose of the Protocol.</text>
        <text type="para">The United States has, however, publicly represented that the reservation is necessary because incendiary weapons are the only weapons that can effectively destroy certain counter-proliferation targets, such as biological weapons facilities, which require high heat to eliminate the biotoxins. The United States has also publicly represented that the reservation is not incompatible with the object and purpose of the Protocol, which is to protect civilians from the collateral damage associated with the use of incendiary weapons. The United States has additionally stated publicly that the reservation is consistent with a key underlying principle of international humanitarian law, which is to reduce risk to the civilian population and civilian objects from harms flowing from armed conflict.</text>
        <text type="para">On the basis that (a) the United States reservation is correctly interpreted as a narrow reservation focused on the use of incendiary weapons against biological weapons, or similar counter-proliferation, facilities that require high heat to eliminate the biotoxins, in the interests of preventing potentially disastrous consequences for the civilian population, (b) the United States reservation is not otherwise intended to detract from the obligation to take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects, and (c) the object and purpose of the Protocol can properly be said to be to protect civilians from the collateral damage associated with the use of incendiary weapons, the United Kingdom would not object to the reservation as contrary to the object and purpose of the Protocol.</text>
