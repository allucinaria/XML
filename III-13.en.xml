Such activities remain subject to other rules of international law. Similarly, as also noted in the said statement, the Convention does not apply where there is a special immunity regime, including immunities ratione personae. Thus, the express mention of heads of State in Article 3 should not be read as suggesting that the immunity ratione personae of other State officials is affected by the Convention.</text>
