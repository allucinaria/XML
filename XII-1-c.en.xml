        <text>Upon depositing its instrument of acceptance of the amendments, the Government of Bahrain reiterated the same declaration as the one made upon accceptance of the Convention (see chapter XII.1).</text>
        <text>In a communication received by the Secretary-General on 8 November 1976, the Government of Bahrain confirmed that the general reservation is intended to constitute a general declaration of policy of the Government of the State of Bahrain and should not be interpreted as expanding or diminishing the scope of the Convention or its application to States parties to the Convention."</text>
        <text>With regard to the said reservation, the Governrment of Israel, in communication received by the Secretary-General on 23 December 1976, stated the following:</text>
        <text>"The instrument deposited by the Government of Bahrain contains a statement of political pronouncements, which are moreover, in flagrant contradiction to the principles, objects and purposes of the Organization. That pronouncement by the Government of Bahrain cannot in any way affect whatever obligations are binding upon Bahrain, under general international law or under particular treaties."</text>
        <text>The Government of Israel will, insofar as concerns the substance of the matter, adopt towards the Government of Bahrain an attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>

That pronouncement by the Government of Iraq cannot in any way affect whatever obligations are binding upon Iraq, under general international law or under particular treaties.</text>
        <text>"The Government of Israel will, insofar as concerns the substance of the matter, adopt towards the Government of Iraq and attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>
