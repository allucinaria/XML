        <text type="title">Proceedings relating to maintenance for minors</text>
        <text type="para">"Maintenance" is understood to mean everything essential for the support, housing, clothing, medical treatment, recreation, comprehensive training and education or instruction of the minor. Maintenance shall include the obligation to pay the mother's pregnancy and childbirth expenses. Article 133, Decree No. 2737 of 1989, Minors' Code.</text>
        <text type="para">Every minor is entitled to the protection, care and assistance necessary to achieve adequate physical, mental, moral and social development, and such rights are recognized from the time of conception. Article 3 of Decree No. 2737, Minors' Code.</text>
        <text type="para">In the event of non-compliance with the maintenance obligation towards a minor, a request for conciliation may be submitted to the Family Ombudsman, the competent judges, the Family Commissioner or the Corrections Inspector of the minor's place of residence by either parent, by the child's relatives, by the guardian or person caring for the child or motu proprio. Article 136, Decree No. 2737 of 1989, Minors' Code.</text>
        <text type="para">The right to claim maintenance may not be waived and is non-transferable in the event of death. The right to claim maintenance may not be sold or assigned in any way.</text>
        <text type="para">The person owing maintenance (respondent) may not ask the claimant to offset that debt with sums owed to him by the claimant.</text>
        <text type="para">Even if the parents have been deprived of parental authority, their maintenance obligation does not cease. This obligation ceases when the minor is adopted.</text>
        <text type="para">As long as the respondent does not fulfil or agree to fulfil the maintenance obligation towards the minor, he may not claim custody and personal care or exercise other rights over the minor.</text>
        <text type="para">When necessary, the judge will decide who is to have custody and care of the minor(s) on whose behalf the proceedings were instituted, without prejudice to the relevant judicial actions. Article 150, Decree No. 2737, Minors' Code.</text>
        <text type="para">An expectant mother may claim maintenance in respect of the offspring of the legitimate father (husband) or of the man who has recognized paternity in the case of a child to be born out of wedlock. Article 135, Decree No. 2737 of 1989, Minors' Code.</text>
        <text type="title">Conciliation</text>

        <text type="para">Article 35 of Act No. 640 of 2001. "Admissibility requirement. In cases suitable for conciliation, extrajudicial conciliation as of right is an admissibility requirement for application to the civil, administrative law, labour and family courts, as specified in this Act for each of these areas."</text>
        <text type="para">Accordingly, in requests for imposition of maintenance payments for a minor, the child's mother or father or the child's relatives or officials dealing with the case may initiate conciliation with the person obligated to pay such maintenance.</text>
        <text type="para">In this case, the (non-compliant) person obligated to pay maintenance will be summoned to the office of the Family Commissioner, the Family Ombudsman or the competent judge to try to reach agreement on the amount of the maintenance payments, the means of making them, their timing and guarantees of observance. The respondent may authorize deduction from his salary of the agreed amounts.</text>
        <text type="para">When conciliation has produced agreement on the maintenance figure, method of payment, timing of the payments and relevant guarantee, a record will be prepared for signature by the presiding official and the parties. The official will then approve it by means of a writ and the conciliation will thus become enforceable; in other words, in caseof non-compliance by the respondent, maintenance enforcement proceedings will be initiated.</text>
        <text type="para">If the person summoned does not appear, after being summoned twice and after the reason for the summons has been given, or if the conciliation fails, the official may establish a provisional maintenance figure and the writ establishing it will be enforceable. The official must submit the claim for maintenance to the competent judge in order for the figure provisionally established to be confirmed by the judge.</text>
        <text type="para">Maintenance conciliations may vary depending on the circumstances of the person obligated to pay maintenance and the needs of the person receiving the financial support. In addition, the judicial decision awarding maintenance may be reviewed in order to revise the maintenance figure, when the respondent is the father of another minor or other minors.</text>
        <text type="para">The conciliation record must contain the following information:</text>
        <text type="para">Place, date and time of the conciliation hearing;</text>

If any document is missing that the claimant is unable to attach, the judge may, at the request of a party or ex officio, order the relevant authority to issue the document.</text>
        <text type="para">If he deems it necessary, the judge may order attachment of the respondent's salary (in an amount that he considers appropriate) in the writ authorizing submission of the claim (in order to guarantee fulfilment of the maintenance obligation), for which purpose he shall communicate officially with the respondent's employer. He may also order retention of an amount that he considers appropriate from the respondent's severance pay, in order to guarantee the minor's maintenance in the event that the respondent resigns or is laid off from his employment.</text>
        <text type="title">Evidence</text>
        <text type="para">Any judicial decision must be based on the evidence duly and regularly produced in the proceedings. Article 174 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</text>

        <text type="para">Evidence is provided at the request of the parties or following an official order from the judge, if he considers it necessary for verification of the facts alleged by the parties.

        <text type="para">Documents. Documents may be public or private. Public documents are those issued by a public official in the performance of his duties or with his intervention. Private documents are those not meeting the requirements to be considered as public documents.</text>
        <text type="para">Authentic document. A document regarding which certainty exists as to the person who drafted, wrote or signed it. A public document is presumed to be authentic, unless the contrary is proved by evidence of forgery. Private documents are authentic if they meet the requirements specified by law.</text>
        <text type="para">In order for proceedings to be initiated for recovery of maintenance for minors, the relationship between the minor claiming maintenance and the person obligated to provide it must be proved. This shall be done by reference to the Civil Registry where the minor's birth is recorded. The financial ability of the respondent to provide maintenance must also be proved, even summarily (reason to believe). If such ability cannot be proved, an analysis will have to be made of the respondent's social position and habits and it will ultimately be presumed that the respondent will pay the minor the minimum wage.</text>
        <text type="para">In order to demonstrate the respondent's ability to pay, a certificate of income and statutory allowances, if he is employed, may be requested as evidence (documentary or oral).

        <text>[The Government of New Zealand] assures the United Nations that the conclusion of the Agreement will not affect the enjoyment by the other Parties to the Convention of their rights under the Convention vis-a-vis the Parties to the Agreement, or the performance of their obligations to other Parties under the Convention. Furthermore, the Agreement to be concluded between the Government of New Zealand and Australia is not considered by them to be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Convention.</text>

        <text>In a communication received on 11 November 1988, the Government of Sweden notified the Secretary-General of the following concerning</text>
        <text>certain of the reservations, made upon ratification of the said Convention:</text>
        <text>(Original: English)</text>
        <text>"Sweden withdraws the reservations made in respect of Article 9, paragraph 2 in the Convention done at New York on</text>
        <text>20 June 1956 on the recovery abroad of maintenance, and makes the following limited reservations in respect of paragraph 1 of</text>
        <text>the same Article:</text>
        <text>Where the proceedings are pending in Sweden, the exemptions in the payment of costs and the facilities provided in paragraph 1 shall be granted only to persons resident in a State Party to the Convention or to any person who would otherwise enjoy such advantages under an agreement concluded</text>
        <text>with the State of which he is a national."</text>

        <text>A. First situation: the Central African Republic has concluded a judicial convention: 1. With France, under the Agreement on Co-operation in Judicial matters, dated 18 January 1965, the Agency which transmits or receives the maintenance claims is the Minister of Justice, Keeper of the Seals. Claims are received or sent in the form of writs of debt, judgements or decrees, and the Ministers of Justice of the two States transmit them to the competent official, in this case the Procureur Général at the Court of Appeals of the respondent's residence, for execution. 2. With the African countries signatories of the Tananarive Convention of 12 September 1961, the exchanges are made through the Procureurs Généraux at the Court of Appeals. B. Second situation: The Central African Republic has not concluded a judicial convention with a particular country. Claims for recovery of maintenance are transmitted by the Procureur général at the Court of Appeals or the Minister of Justice, who refers them to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Central African Republic, who refers them to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the country where the respondent resides. Claims originated abroad follow the same procedure.</text>
