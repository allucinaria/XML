        <Participant>Mexico</Participant>
        <text type="title">Reservation made upon signature and confirmed upon ratification:</text>
        <text type="para">"The Delegation of Mexico, in accordance with the declaration duly made when the matter was under discussion in Working Party I, reserves its rights with regard to article 4, which authorizes the temporary importation of component parts for the repair of motor vehicles. The Delegation cannot agree to this article because the procedure in question is contrary to the legislation of its country, and because such spare parts do not usually have the specifications which would permit of their identification on exit. In the Delegation's opinion, this procedure would be prejudicial to the country's fiscal interests, because in this way it would be possible to import new spare parts without payment of duty by re-exporting old parts belonging to a vehicle not the tourist's own. It has therefore been considered more appropriate that in such cases the proper duty should be paid.</text>

        <text>The Secretary-General circulated on 6 April 1979 the text of an amendment proposed by Switzerland aiming at the addition of a new article 25 &lt;superscript&gt;bis&lt;/superscript&gt; to chapter VII of the Convention. The said amendment was not accepted owing to objections notified to the Secretary-General on 2 October 1979 (India) and on 4 October 1979 (Belgium, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).</text>
        <text>Subsequently, the text of a new amendment by Switzerland (new article 25 &lt;superscript&gt;bis&lt;/superscript&gt; ) was circulated by the Secretary-General on 23 July 1984. No objections having been notified within a period of six months from the date of its circulation, the amendment entered into force on 23 April 1985 in accordance with article 42 (3) of the Convention.</text>
        <text>However, the Secretary-General received in this regard, on 22 January 1985, from the Government of Austria the following declaration:</text>
        <text>"Austria does not object to the substance of the amendment proposed by Switzerland which has been approved by the Austrian Federal Government on December 12, 1984. But as the Austrian constitutional procedures in the present case also require the ratification by the Federal President after approval by parliament, Austria is not yet in a position to apply the new regulations. Austria does, however, not wish to prevent the entry into force of the present amendment for the other contracting states.</text>
        <text>Subsequently, on 7 June 1985, the Secretary-General was informed by the Government of Austria that "the said amendment had been approved by the Austrian Parliament and that it would therefore now be applied by Austria."</text>
        <text>On 30 January 1992, the Secretary-General circulated the text of the amendments to the English, French and Spanish authentic texts proposed by the Government of Italy. In this connexion, it is to be noted that the said amendments, as circulated by depositary notification C.N.315.1991.TREATIES-1 dated 30 January 1992, indeedentered into force on 30 October 1992, with the exception, however, of the proposed amendment to article 13, consisting in the addition of a fourth paragraph: an objection was formulated by Japan to the said proposed amendment on 30 July 1992, i.e., within the period of six months from the date of the relevant depositary notification as follows:</text>
        <text>". . . The Government of Japan considers that the proposed provisions of article 13, paragraph 4, setting forth the exemption from taxation in case of loss or theft of an object in the case of a seizure, do not appear precise enough to ensure the prevention of its abuse. For this reason, the Government of Japan considers that the proposed amendments should not be adopted and therefore expresses its objection to them in accordance with article 42 (2) of the Convention."</text>
        <text>Consequently, in accordance with article 42 (3), all amendments proposed by Italy entered into force for all Contracting Parties three months after the expiration of the period of six months following the date of circulation of the proposed amendment by the Secretary-General, i.e., on 30 October 1992, with the exception of the proposed fourth paragraph to article 13.</text>
