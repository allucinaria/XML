        <text>"The instrument of acceptance by the Government of Kuwait of the Protocol contains a statement of a political character in respect to Israel.

That statement, therefore, possesses no legal validity whatsoever.</text>
        <text>"The Government of Israel utterly rejects that statement and will proceed on the assumption that it has no validity as to the rights and duties of any State Party to the said treaties.</text>
        <text>"The declaration of the Government of Kuwait cannot in any way affect Kuwait's obligations under whatever other obligations are binding upon that State by virtue of general international law.</text>
