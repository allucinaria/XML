        <TreatyNote>
          <Text>The Agreement and Protocol were adopted by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Caribbean Development Bank which met at Kingston, Jamaica, on 18 October 1969. The Conference was convened for that purpose by the Acting Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Caribbean Regional Secretariat in accordance with the decision of the Commonwealth Caribbean Conference of Finance Ministers taken at its meeting held at Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, on 22 July 1969. Both instruments were opened for signature by the Plenipotentiary Conference at Kingston on 18 October 1969. The Conference also adopted the Final Act, approved the memorandum of understanding relating to the allocation of the Bank's resources to multinational projects, which had been adopted by the Conference of Finance Ministers at Port of Spain, and adopted the resolution on the duties of the Trustee designated under article 7, paragraph (8), of the Agreement. The texts of the said memorandum and resolution are appended to the Final Act as annexes A and B.</Text>
          <Text>The Protocol, to provide for procedure for amendment of article 36 of the Agreement, became void, when the amendment proposed under the said procedure at the Inaugural Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Caribbean Development Bank, held at Nassau, Bahamas, on 31 January 1970, had failed to obtain the required majority.</Text>
          <Text>By Resolution No. 9/76 adopted on 20 August 1976, the Board of Governors of the Bank has amended article 29 (1) (a) of the Agreement (number of Directors) with effect from 2 September 1976.</Text>
          <Text>Subsequently, by Resolution No. 3/85 of 15 May 1985, the Board of Governors of the Bank adopted amendments to articles 25, 33, 34, 35 and 57 of the Agreement with effect from 24 June 1985.</Text>

        <text type="para">"This declaration does not exclude the immunities provided for in the Agreement establishing the Caribbean Development Bank. It is only intended as a safeguard instrument in respect of Bank representatives, recognizing the Italian Government's authority and power to take exceptional measures in case of extraordinary circumstances regarding public order and national security. In those circumstances, the Government of Italy would give treatment to the Bank's representatives no less favourable than what is accorded by Italy to representatives of any other Member of the Bank as contemplated by article 54 (B) and (C) of the agreement establishing the Bank. Therefore, this declaration is not a reservation. The possibility that this declaration will ever have practical relevance is indeed very remote. In fact, it will be applicable only when extraordinary events occur during the stay in Italy of representatives of the Bank who are not citizens or nationals of Italy."</text>

        <text>In its instrument of ratification, the Government of British Honduras further declared that the Agreement was ratified subject ". . . to the condition that the Government of British Honduras undertakes that legislation to give effect to the immunities and privileges to be conferred on the Bank in British Honduras by virtue of the Agreement will be passed on or before February 21st, 1970."</text>
        <text>Paragraph (d) of the United Kingdom declaration and the declaration by the Government of British Honduras, not being provided for in paragraph 3 of article 63 of the Agreement, the Government of the United Kingdom informed the Secretary-General that all signatories to the Agreement had been consulted in connection therewith and, in particular, that "the signatories to the Agreement were requested to notify any objection on their part to these declarations and no objection has been notified by any signatory." With reference to these declarations, the Secretary-General, in his report of 27 January 1970 to the Board of Governors of the Caribbean Development Bank on the status of the Agreement, stated that, inasmuch as the said declarations were not provided in the Agreement, but having taken note of the information given in their respect by the Government of the United Kingdom, he had received the instruments of ratification of the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of British Honduras provisionally in deposit, without prejudice to and pending the decision of the competent organ of the Caribbean Development Bank as to the acceptability of the declarations concerned.</text>
        <text>In a communication received by the Secretary-General on 30 January 1970, the Government of British Honduras notified him of the withdrawal of the pertinent part of its declaration. In so far as concerns paragraph (d) of the declaration of the United Kingdom, the Acting Secretary of the Caribbean Development Bank informed the Secretary-General that the Board of Governors of the Bank, at the inaugural meeting held on 31 January 1970, had decided to accept the conditions accompanying the United Kingdom ratification and had requested him to notify the Secretary-General of its decision. As a result of these actions, the Secretary-General considered the instruments of ratification by the Government of British Honduras and the Government of the United Kingdom as definitively desited and informed all Governments concerned and the Bank accordingly.</text>

        <text>Paragraph (d) of the United Kingdom declaration and the declaration by the Government of British Honduras, not being provided for in paragraph 3 of article 63 of the Agreement, the Government of the United Kingdom informed the Secretary-General that all signatories to the Agreement had been consulted in connection therewith and, in particular, that "the signatories to the Agreement were requested to notify any objection on their part to these declarations and no objection has been notified by any signatory." With reference to these declarations, the Secretary-General, in his report of 27 January 1970 to the Board of Governors of the Caribbean Development Bank on the status of the Agreement, stated that, inasmuch as the said declarations were not provided in the Agreement, but having taken note of the information given in their respect by the Government of the United Kingdom, he had received the instruments of ratification of the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of British Honduras provisionally in deposit, without prejudice to and pending the decision of the competent organ of the Caribbean Development Bank as to the acceptability of the declarations concerned.</text>
        <text>In a communication received by the Secretary-General on 30 January 1970, the Government of British Honduras notified him of the withdrawal of the pertinent part of its declaration. In so far as concerns paragraph (d) of the declaration of the United Kingdom, the Acting Secretary of the Caribbean Development Bank informed the Secretary-General that the Board of Governors of the Bank, at the inaugural meeting held on 31 January 1970, had decided to accept the conditions accompanying the United Kingdom ratification and had requested him to notify the Secretary-General of its decision. As a result of these actions, the Secretary-General considered the instruments of ratification by the Government of British Honduras and the Government of the United Kingdom as definitively desited and informed all Governments concerned and the Bank accordingly.</text>
