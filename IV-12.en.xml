        <text type="para">The Government of the French Republic has examined the reservation made by the Government of the Republic of El Salvador upon accession to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty.</text>
        <text type="para">In that reservation, the Government of the Republic of El Salvador states that it intends to make use of the right contained in article 2, paragraph 1 of the Protocol, providing for application of the death penalty in certain situations, pursuant to article 27 of the Constitution of El Salvador, according to which The death penalty may be imposed only in the cases provided by the military laws during an international state of war.</text>
        <text type="para">Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Protocol, however, requires that application of the death penalty be limited, in time of war to cases in which there is a conviction for a most serious crime of a military nature committed during wartime.</text>

        <text type="para">The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has carefully examined the reservation made by the Republic of El Salvador upon its accession to the Second Optional Protocol.</text>
        <text type="para">It recalls, that the complete abolition of the death penalty is the object and purpose of the Second Optional Protocol, and that according to Article 2 reservations are not permissible with the one exception of a reservation that provides for the application of the death penalty in time of war pursuant to a conviction for a most serious crime of a military nature committed during war time. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany believes that the reservation made by the Republic of El Salvador goes beyond the limits of Article 2 of the Optional Protocol, as it does not explicitly limit the application of the death penalty to the most serious crimes of a military nature. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany therefore considers the reservation made by the Republic of El Salvador to be incompatible with the object and purpose of the Second Optional Protocol and that it consequently has to be considered impermissible.</text>

        <text type="para">The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands recalls that it is the object and purpose of the Second Optional Protocol to abolish the death penalty in all circumstances and reservations are, as a main rule, not admissible. This object of aiming at the complete abolition of the death penalty enjoys the full support of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. However, the Government observes that, in the light of the wording of Article 2(1), a reservation to the Protocol is allowed to the extent that it concerns the application of the death penalty in times of war pursuant to a conviction for a most serious crime of a military nature committed during wartime. The acceptability of such a reservation requires that the State Party making the reservation communicates, at the time of ratification or accession, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the relevant provisions of its national legislation applicable during wartime.</text>
        <text type="para">Accordingly, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands would find the reservation made by El Salvador acceptable, provided that it meets the requirements set out in Article 2(1) and (2). However, according to information available to the Government, the applicable provisions of the national legislation of El Salvador specifying the application of the death penalty to the most serious crimes of a military nature in wartime were not communicated to the Secretary-General at the time of accession. Therefore, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands objects to the reservation.</text>

        <text type="para">While making the reservation [the] Republic of El Salvador invoked the article 27 of its Constitution, which refers to unspecified military laws. The Government of the Republic of Poland notes that [the] Republic of El Salvador refers in its reservation to the domestic legislation possibly affecting the application of the Protocol, including the admissibility of application of death penalty, without specifying the exact content of this legislation. As a result, it is impossible to clearly define the extent to which the reserving State will accept the application of the death penalty and if such an application will be limited to the most serious crimes of a military nature committed during wartime. Thus the reservation is not compatible with the art. 2 of the Protocol and it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the Protocol. According to customary international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a reservation that is incompatible with the object and purposeof a treaty shall not be permitted.</text>

        <text>&lt;i&gt;France (8 february 2000): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>The Government of the French Republic has taken note of the reservation made by Azerbaijan to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, which was adopted on 15 December 1989. This reservation, in allowing the application of the death penalty for grave crimes committed during war or in condition of the threat of war', exceeds the scope of the reservations permitted under article 2, paragraph 1, of the Protocol. Under this article, only a reservation made at the time of ratification or accession that provides for the application of the death penalty in time of war pursuant to a conviction for a most serious crime of a military nature committed during wartime' is admissible. Consequently, the Government of the French Republic expresses its objection to this reservation, without prejudice to the entry into force of the Protocol between Azerbaijan and France.</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Finland (17 March 2000): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The Government of Finland notes that, according to Article 2 of the Second Optional Protocol, a reservation other than the kind referred to in the same Article is not acceptable. The reservation made by the Government of Azerbaijan is partly in contradiction with Article 2 as it does not limit theapplication of death penalty to the most serious crimes of a military nature committed during the time of war.</text>
        <text>The Government of Finland therefore objects to the reservation made by the Government of Azerbaijan to the said Protocol.</text>
        <text>This objection does not preclude the entry into force of the Second Optional Protocol between Azerbaijan and Finland. The Optional Protocol will thus become operative between the two states without Azerbaijan benefitting from the reservation."</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;GermanyMarch 2000): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>"The reservation allows the application of the death penalty for grave crimes committed during war or in condition of the threat of war. Thus the reservation is partly in contradiction of article 2 of the Protocol since it does not limit the application of the death penalty to the most serious crimes of a military nature committed during the time of war.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany therefore objects to the reservation by the Government of Azerbaijan. This objection does not preclude the entry into force of the Protocol between Azerbaijan and Germany."</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Sweden (27 April 2000): &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text>The Government of Sweden recalls that reservations other than the kind referred to in Article 2 of the Protocol are not permitted. The reservation made by the Government of Azerbaijan goes beyond the limit of Article 2 of the Protocol, as it does not limit the application of the death penalty to the most serious crimes of a military nature committed during the time of war.</text>
        <text>The Government of Sweden therefore objects to the aforesaid reservation made by the Government of Azerbaijan to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</text>
        <text>This shall not preclude the entry into force of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Kingdom of Sweden, without Azerbaijan benefiting from the reservation."</text>
        <text>&lt;i&gt;Netherlands (17 July 2000) &lt;/i&gt;</text>
        <text> The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands notes that, according to Article 2 of the Second Optional Protocol, a reservation other than the kind referred to in the same Article is not acceptable. The reservation made by the Government of Azerbaijan is in contradiction with Article 2 as it does not limit the application of death penalty to the most serious crimes of a military nature committed during the time of war.</text>
        <text>The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands therefore objehe aforesaid reservation made by the Government of Azerbaijan.</text>
        <text>This objection shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Azerbaijan."</text>
        <text>Subsequently, on 28 September 2000, the Government of Azerbaijan communicated to the Secretary-General a modification to its reservation made upon accession. Within a period of 12 months from the date of its circulation, i.e. on 5 October 2000, none of the Contracting States to the Protocol notified the Secretary-General of an objection. Consequently, the modified reservation was deemed to have been accepted for deposit upon the expiration of the 12 month period, i.e., on 5 October 2001.</text>
