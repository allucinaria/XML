        <text>The Secretary-General received on 23 June 1980 from the Government of Israel the following communication concerning this declaration:</text>
        <text>"The Government of Israel has noted the political character of the statement made by the Government of Iraq. In the view of the Government of Israel, this Convention is not the proper place for making such political pronouncements. Moreover, the said declar- ation cannot in any way affect whatever obligations are binding upon Iraq under general international law or under particular conventions. Insofar as concerns the substance of the matter, the Government of Israel will adopt towards the Government of Iraq an attitude of complete reciprocity."</text>
        <text>Subsequently, on 23 May 1983, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Israel a declaration concerning the declaration made by Morocco, identical in essence, &lt;i&gt;mutatis mutandis &lt;/i&gt;, as the one made regarding the declaration made by Iraq.</text>
