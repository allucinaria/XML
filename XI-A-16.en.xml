        <text type="para">. . . On behalf of the Member States of the European Economic Community and of the Community itself, of the reaction on the Community side to this statement by the People's Republic of Bulgaria. It should be recalled that the conference which took place in Geneva, from 8 to 14 November 1975 under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe for the purpose of revising the TIR Convention decided that customs or economic unions might become contracting parties to the Convention at the same time as all their Member States or at any time after all their Member States had become contracting parties to the Convention.</text>
        <text type="para">In accordance with this provision as contained in article 52 (3) of the Convention the European Economic Community, which participated in the above-mentioned conference, signed the Convention on 30 December 1976.</text>
        <text type="para">It shall also be recalled that the TIR Convention prohibits any reservation on the Convention, with the exception of reservations to the provisions contained in article 57 paragraphs (2) to (6) thereof on the compulsory settlement of disputes arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention. The statement made by Bulgaria concerning article 52 (3) has the appearance of a reservation to that provision, although such reservation is expressly prohibited by the Convention.</text>
