        <text>The former Yugoslavia had acceded to the Convention on 26 February 1982 with the following reservation:</text>
        <text>"1. The Convention is applied in regard to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia only to those arbitral awards which were adopted after the coming of the Convention into effect.</text>
        <text>2. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will apply the Convention on a reciprocal basis only to those arbitral awards which were adopted on the territory of the other State Party to the Convention.</text>
        <text>"3. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will apply the Convention [only] with respect to the disputes arising from the legal relations, contractual and non-contractual, which, according to its national legislation are considered as economic."</text>
        <text>In a latter declaration dated 28 June 1982, the Government of Yugoslavia had specified that the first reservation only constituted an affirmation of the legal principle of retroactivity and that the third reservation being essentially in accordance with article I (3) of the Convention, the word "only" was therefore to be added to the original text and note taken that the word "economic" had been used therein as a synonym for "commercial".</text>

        <text>"The Government of Israel has noted the political character of the statement made by the Government of Jordan.
