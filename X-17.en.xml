If a receivable is assigned pursuant to a contract of assignment concluded before the date when this Convention enters into force in repsect of the Contracting State referred in article 1, paragraph 1 (a), the right of the assignee has priority over the right of a competing claimant with respect to the receivable to the extent that, under the law that would determine priority in the absence of this Convention, the right of the assignee would have priority.".</Labeltext>
